# NLU First Assignment
Repository for the first assignment of the Natural Language Understanding course

Student: Andrea Rigo
# Requirements
`Python`, `spaCy` and `Jupyter Notebooks`
# Test the code
Each function has its own cell in the notebook and has its test right after the definition. So to test the code its sufficient to run all the notebook, or re-run a cell if you want to modify the way a function is tested.

To obtain the outputs present in the notebook I used `Python 3.8.8`, `spaCy 3.0.5` and the pipeline `en_core_web_sm 3.0.0`. If you have different versions you could have different results.
